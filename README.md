# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
CodSoft Task - 3
COMPANY : CODSOFT
NAME : SATYAJIT PARIDA 
INTERN ID : CS25RY6165

I created a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and implemented in Google Colab! This system suggests movies to users based on their preferences using content-based filtering. By leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the model analyzes movie genres to provide accurate recommendations.
ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
 âœ… you can also add movie name and it's description in dataset manually.
 âœ… TF-IDF Vectorization to process and analyze movie genres.
 âœ… Cosine Similarity to find the most relevant movie recommendations.
 âœ… Interactive Google Colab implementation, making it easy to use and experiment with.

 Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of machine learning, natural language processing, and data science techniques. It was a great learning experience as part of my CodSoft Internship, and I look forward to building more advanced recommendation systems using collaborative filtering and deep learning.
